# ChessSimulator
An updated version of a Chess Simulator application I wrote in college.

This project takes advantage of polymorphism and inheritance, as well as other good practices.
To compile, use the command "javac ChessGame.java".
To run, use the command: "java ChessGame".

Current state:
The application's main features include correctly recognizing the possible moves for a referenced chess piece, as well as the ability to move and remove these pieces to manually simulate a chess game.

Future additions:
Allow 2 players to play a game through the terminal.
Implement a GUI to allow physical moving of the pieces.
